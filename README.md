# Fundamental Regression Pipeline

This is a **foundation project** to build procedural fluency in regression.

## Goal
Build one clean, correct regression pipeline that can be reused on any tabular dataset.

Focus is on **correct sequencing and decisions**.

This repo is about **muscle memory and building fluency**, not novelty.
