# Regression Fundamentals – Execution Project

This is a **private foundation project** to build procedural fluency in regression.

## Goal
Build one clean, correct regression pipeline that can be reused on any tabular dataset.

## Scope (current state)
- Dataset: California Housing
- Environment: Python + venv
- Defined X and y correctly
- Train / Validation / Test split (60 / 20 / 20)
- Implemented a constant baseline (mean predictor)
- Evaluated baseline using MSE

No feature engineering, no fancy models yet — focus is on **correct sequencing and decisions**.

## Why this exists
Seeing pipelines ≠ executing pipelines.  
This repo is about **muscle memory**, not novelty.
